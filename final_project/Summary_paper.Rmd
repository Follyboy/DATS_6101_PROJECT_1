## **INTRODUCTION**\
First, what is a stroke? A stroke is a medical condition that occurs when the blood supply is blocked to parts of the brain or when a blood vessel in the brain bursts. The main risk factor for stroke is high blood pressure; other risk factors include high blood cholesterol and tobacco smoking.
The goal of our project is to diagnose whether a person is prone to develop a stroke or not based on ten generic physiological factors.\

Our team searched multiple datasets online with a common goal of working on some medical research datasets. After a few hours of finding the perfect dataset, we all agreed to perform exploratory data analysis on the Brain Stroke dataset. We finalized this dataset as brain stroke was the second most frequent death factor in 2015, so we knew that the analysis of this dataset would be of great significance. To understand this dataset completely, we all researched the dataset and the biological and physiological factors impacting brain stroke. Some of the prevalent factors we studied about very obesity, smoking, high cholesterol, diabetes, and a history of heart disease. Luckily we had the same columns in the dataset too.\



## **UNDERSTANDING OUR DATASET**\
The dataset consists of $43401$ entries comprising $11$ features, including label feature: Stroke - $1$ (has a stroke) or $0$ (no stroke).\
1. gender: "Male", "Female" or "Other"\
2. age: age of the patient\
3. hypertension: $0$ (does not have hypertension), $1$ (hypertension)\
4. heart disease: $0$ if the patient does not have any heart diseases, $1$ if the patient has a heart disease\
5. ever-married: "No" or "Yes"\
6. worktype: "children", "Govt_job", "Never_worked", "Private" or "Self-employed"\
7. Residencetype: "Rural" or "Urban"\
8. avgglucoselevel: average glucose level in blood\
9. bmi: body mass index\
10. smoking_status: "formerly smoked", "never smoked", "smokes" or "Unknown"\
11. stroke: $1$ if the patient had a stroke or $0$ if not (dependent variable)\

```{r, results='markup'}
data <- data.frame(read.csv("dataset.csv"))
brainData <- select(data, -c('id'))
```

```{r, results='markup'}
#gender,hypertension,heart_disease,ever_married,work_type,Residence_type,smoking_status,stroke
brainData$gender = factor(brainData$gender)
brainData$hypertension = factor(brainData$hypertension)
brainData$heart_disease = factor(brainData$heart_disease)
brainData$ever_married = factor(brainData$ever_married)
brainData$work_type = factor(brainData$work_type)
brainData$Residence_type = factor(brainData$Residence_type)
brainData$smoking_status = factor(brainData$smoking_status)
brainData$stroke = factor(brainData$stroke)
cleanData <- brainData  # just for running code right now
summary(brainData)
```


We were curious about a few factors listed above, like gender, work type, residence type, and marital status, and how these factors can affect the probability of brain stroke occurrence. We expected that factors like smoking status, BMI, hypertension, and heart disease would be very significant as there is substantial research evidence for the effect on brain stroke.\
**We can plot some graphs related to the dataset here if any**\

## **FRAMING SMART QUESTIONS**\
To understand the dataset better and to have some concrete conclusion, we framed a few SMART questions:\

***1. Do age, work type, and gender contribute to a person's smoking status, as there are unknown values in that column?***\
While exploring the data, we found that about 30 percent of values under smoking status are unknown (or missing). We wanted to fill out those values to bridge the gap of the missing values. We wanted to check some relationships between smoking status and other factors.

***2. How is the stroke related to the person's smoking status, hypertension, and heart disease?***\
From our initial research, cigarette smoking, high blood pressure, and a history of heart disease are some significant factors for brain stroke. So, we had this curiosity about how much they impact stroke with some mathematical backing.

***3. Are glucose levels and BMI correlated to each other?***\
Through our basic understanding, we thought there could be a solid direct relationship between glucose levels and BMI. We framed this question to have a more concrete understanding of their association.

***4. Is ever married column in any way contributing to the stroke?***\
We were curious about whether marital status has any impact on brain stroke.

## **LIMITATIONS OF THE DATASET**\

Since the dataset has $42617$ observations for stroke = $0$ and $783$ observations for stroke = $1$. We faced the problem of class imbalance. If we had more entries with stroke the results would have been more accurate medically. Even though we solved this issue using  *Synthetic Minority Over-Sampling Technique(SMOTE)*, which is a  Intelligent Sampling technique that generate new entries for minority class based on nearest neighbor approach. 


## **CLEANING OUR DATASET**\

As seen from the summary missing values are observed in following variables.\ 
 
 * BMI - NA's : $1462$ 
 * Smoking_status : empty string would be treated as a missing value only : $13292$\
 * Gender : Since there are only $11$ entries in *Other* we will get rid of that too.\ 

And,\ 
```{r results='markup'}
subset_0 <- subset(brainData,brainData$stroke==0)
subset_1 <- subset(brainData,brainData$stroke==1)

value_0 = nrow(subset_1)
value_1 = nrow(subset_0)
```

* Number of observations for people with stroke( stroke = 1 ) are  $`r value_0`$
* Number of observations for people without stroke( stroke = 0 ) are  $`r value_1`$

### **CLASS IMBALANCE PROBLEM**\

```{r, echo=FALSE,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE,error=FALSE, results='hide',fig.keep='all'}

# Categorical data
#Stroke_Var <- factor(c(rep("Stroke 0", value_0),
#                    rep("Stroke 1", value_1)))

# Store the variable as data frame
#Stroke_Data <- data.frame(Stroke_Var)

# Pie
#cols <-  hcl.colors(length(levels(Stroke_Var)), "Fall")
#PieChart(Stroke_Var, data = Stroke_Data, hole = 0,
#         fill = cols,
#         labels_cex = 0.6)

cols <-  hcl.colors(length(levels(cleanData$stroke)), "Fall")
PieChart(stroke, data = cleanData, hole = 0,
         fill = cols,
         labels_cex = 0.6)
```

We can clearly see that the difference is huge, which is why we got wrong results for most of our testing. After researching more about this problem we found out that it is commonly known as **Class Imbalance Problem**.\


The unequal distribution of data causes inaccurate calculations for accuracy and testings, since even when it is predicting all values as stroke = 0, it would still achieve 98% accuracy in our case. So to avoid this problem there are a lot of approaches that we can take. We need to get rid of the missing values in our dataset first. 


### **CLEANING SMOKING STATUS**\
We see that there are $13292$ missing (or unknown values) in smoking_status which is approximately $31%$ of the complete dataset we have.\
We wanted to know some relationship between smoking status and other variables so as to fill out the missing values hence framed *SMART question 1*\

### **SMART QUESTION 1**\
To answer SMART question 1, we plotted few graphs and did some testing to check the dependence of smoking_status on other variables.\

```{r}
ggplot(brainData, aes(x = smoking_status, y = age, fill = work_type)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("orange", "red", "green","blue","yellow")) +
  labs(title = "Age versus Smoking status color coded by work type")
```

**Analysis from the graph above**\

$1.$ We can fill the values of age less than $15$ in 'never smoked' (children) as it is very unlikely that people under that age group smokes who have not 
mentioned explicitly.\
$2.$ People who have never worked mostly lies in formerly smoked category.\

So, based on above analysis, smoking status has a very small relation with age and worktype but nothing concrete could be concluded based on the data we have.\

```{r}
ggplot(brainData, aes(x = smoking_status, y = age, fill = gender)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("pink", "blue", "green")) +
  labs(title = "Age versus Smoking status color coded by gender")
```

The plot of gender for male and female is almost similar for all three categories.\
There are only few entries for others, so itâ€™s not providing important relations.\

Hence, from the above plot we can say that gender is not affecting smoking status and we cannot fill out smoking status missing values using that.\

**TESTING TO CHECK DEPENDENCE OF SMOKING STATUS ON OTHER FACTORS**\
```{r}
contable_smoke_age = table(brainData$smoking_status, brainData$age)
contable_smoke_gender = table(brainData$smoking_status, brainData$gender)
contable_smoke_work = table(brainData$smoking_status, brainData$work_type)

chitest_smoke_age = chisq.test(contable_smoke_age)
chitest_smoke_gender = chisq.test(contable_smoke_gender)
chitest_smoke_work = chisq.test(contable_smoke_work)

print(chitest_smoke_age)
print(chitest_smoke_gender)
print(chitest_smoke_work)
```

We did **CHI SQUARE TEST** to check the dependence of smoking_status on the age, gender and worktype.\
From the results above, we can see that the p-value is very small for all the three factors which means that smoking_status is not dependent on any of these factors.\

**From the hypothesis testing and the plots, we concluded that not much can be commented on the smoking status w.r.t. other factors like age, gender and worktype. So we decided to drop the unknown values from smoking_status as the constitute 31 percent of the whole dataset. Filling them out would affect the integrity of the data.**\

So we will remove the missing values from smoking status now.\

* Number of observations before cleaning Smoking status : `r nrow(brainData)`\

```{r results='markup'}

cleanData = brainData #we will now clean the data and store it in a new variable 

cleanData[cleanData == ''] <- NA #replacing empty string with NA values
#nrow(cleanData)
cleanData <- subset(cleanData, !is.na(smoking_status))
#nrow(cleanData)
```

* Number of observations after cleaning Smoking status : `r nrow(cleanData)`\

### **GENDER**

* Number of observations before cleaning Gender : `r nrow(cleanData)`

```{r, results='markup'}
drop_others = subset(cleanData, cleanData$gender != 'Other')
table(drop_others$gender)
cleanData <- drop_others

```

* Number of observations after cleaning Gender : `r nrow(cleanData)`

### **BMI**\ 
Analysis for BMI NULL values.\
```{r,  fig.show="hold", out.width="50%"}
ggplot(data=brainData, aes(bmi)) +
geom_histogram(col="black",
fill="blue") +
labs(x="bmi", y="frequency") +
labs(title="plot of BMI")

tempdf <- subset(brainData, !is.na(bmi))  # removing NA values from bmi and storing it in tempdf
density_bmi <- density(tempdf$bmi)
plot(density_bmi, main= "Density Curve of BMI") # title(main="Density curve of BMI")  #plotting the density curve of bmi values

```

```{r, results='markup'}
skewness_value <- skewness(tempdf$bmi)
```
Skewness value: `r skewness_value`


From the density curve and skewness value, BMI is rightly skewed. So mean is not the right central tendency to fill NA values in BMI.
We will NA values in BMI using median of the data.
Note: Negative skewness value indicates left skewed and positive skewness value indicates right skewed.
The rule of thumb seems to be:

* If the skewness is between -0.5 and 0.5, the data are fairly symmetrical
* If the skewness is between -1 and â€“ 0.5 or between 0.5 and 1, the data are moderately skewed
* If the skewness is less than -1 or greater than 1, the data are highly skewed

Replacing Missing Values for BMI with median.

```{r results='markup'}

#removing missing values for BMI
cleanData$bmi[is.na(cleanData$bmi)] <- median(cleanData$bmi, na.rm = T) #replacing NA values with median of the remaining bmi values.
#summary(cleanData)
```

 
Now that we have replaced our missing values we can move forward to solve our problem of class imbalance. 

### **SMOTE FOR UPSAMPLING**\

SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-Sampling Technique) is an intelligent upsampling technique that focuses on creating the new entries along the lines of a randomly chosen point and its nearest neighbors of minority class(to avoid overfitting). This is better than blindly duplicating values since it gives some variation in the same group itself. \
Along with upsampling the minority class it also downsamples the majority class using same technique. \

Before sampling : \ 

* Stroke 0 : `r nrow(subset(cleanData,cleanData$stroke == 0)) `
* Stroke 1 : `r nrow(subset(cleanData,cleanData$stroke == 1)) `


```{r results='markup'}
#table(cleanData$stroke)
#use SMOTE to create new dataset that is more balanced
cleanData <- SMOTE(stroke ~ ., cleanData, perc.over = 2000, perc.under = 200)
#minority => 2000/100 =20 so 20*(strok1Observations=416) #upsampling 
#200/100 =2, make the majority observation 2 time the minority observations #downsampling 

#view distribution of response variable in new dataset
#table(cleanData$stroke)
```
After Sampling : \

* Stroke 0 : `r nrow(subset(cleanData,cleanData$stroke == 0)) `
* Stroke 1 : `r nrow(subset(cleanData,cleanData$stroke == 1)) `

```{r, echo=FALSE,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE,error=FALSE, results='hide',fig.keep='all'}
#modifying values 
#subset_0 <- subset(cleanData,cleanData$stroke==0)
#subset_1 <- subset(cleanData,cleanData$stroke==1)

#value_0 = nrow(subset_1)
#value_1 = nrow(subset_0)


# Categorical data
#Stroke_Data <- factor(c(rep("Stroke 0", value_0),
#                    rep("Stroke 1", value_1)))

# Store the variable as data frame
#stroke_ <- data.frame(Stroke_Data)

# Pie
#cols <-  hcl.colors(length(levels(Stroke_Data)), "Fall")
#PieChart(Stroke_Data, data = stroke_, hole = 0,
#         fill = cols,
 #        labels_cex = 0.6)


cols <-  hcl.colors(length(levels(cleanData$stroke)), "Fall")
PieChart(stroke, data = cleanData, hole = 0,
         fill = cols,
         labels_cex = 0.6)
```

Now that we have upsampled our minority class, we will look at the distribution of numeric variables to look for outliers.\ 

Numeric Variables\

* Age\
* BMI\
* Average Glucose Level\

Let's check their QQ plots and box plots.\

### **Q-Q PLOTS**\

To check normality of Numeric Variables we plotted QQ Plots\ 

As seen below,\ 

* The distributions for BMI and Average Glucose Level are away from Normal Distribution.\
* For age, the distribution is not very far from normal\

Let's check the boxplots next to know about the range of outliers. Since, it might be possible that the outliers carry some significance with them and it's not a great idea to remove them straight away.\     

```{r, figures-side, fig.show="hold", out.width="33%"}
qqnorm(brainData$age, main="Q-Q plot of Age", col="blue", ylab="Age quantiles")
qqline(brainData$age)

qqnorm(brainData$bmi, main="Q-Q plot of BMI", col="green", ylab="BMI quantiles")
qqline(brainData$bmi)

qqnorm(brainData$avg_glucose_level, main="Q-Q plot of Average Glucose Level", col="red", ylab="avg_glucose_level quantiles")
qqline(brainData$avg_glucose_level)

```

Looking at the box plots we get an idea that\ 

* The max value for age is around `r max(cleanData$age)` as seen from summary as well.\
* Medically having `r max(cleanData$age)` years as age is possible.\
* **Their is a huge difference in mean of people with and without stroke for age**\ 
* Their are no missing values and outliers for age so we do not need to clean it.\

```{r, results='markup'}
#concise box plot for numeric variables

plot_boxplot(brainData, by = "stroke")
cleanData_outliers = cleanData

```

### **REMOVING OUTLIERS**\

#### **REMOVING OUTLIERS: BMI**\

```{r results='markup'}

#dim(cleanData)
quartiles_bmi <- quantile(cleanData_outliers$bmi, probs=c(.25, .75), na.rm = FALSE)
IQR_bmi <- IQR(cleanData_outliers$bmi)

 
Lower_bmi <- quartiles_bmi[1] - 1.5*IQR_bmi
Upper_bmi <- quartiles_bmi[2] + 1.5*IQR_bmi

#since all the missing values are for stroke =0 entries, we will directly drop it

cleanData_outliers <- subset(cleanData_outliers, cleanData_outliers$bmi > Lower_bmi & cleanData_outliers$bmi < Upper_bmi)

#dim(cleanData)
```

If we notice here : \
After removing the outliers the max value in our radius was `r Upper_bmi` but, medically BMI can be higher than this value and hence we will increase our range\

```{r results='markup'}
cleanData_outliers = cleanData
#dim(cleanData)
quartiles_bmi <- quantile(cleanData_outliers$bmi, probs=c(.25, .95), na.rm = FALSE)
IQR_bmi <- IQR(cleanData_outliers$bmi)

 
Lower_bmi <- quartiles_bmi[1] - 1.5*IQR_bmi
Upper_bmi <- quartiles_bmi[2] + 1.5*IQR_bmi

#since all the missing values are for stroke =0 entries, we will directly drop it

cleanData_outliers <- subset(cleanData_outliers, cleanData_outliers$bmi > Lower_bmi & cleanData_outliers$bmi < Upper_bmi)

#dim(cleanData)
```
So to increase range, we increased the quartile range from 75% to 95%.\

Now, the maximum value of bmi that we get after removing outliers is  : `r Upper_bmi`\

#### **REMOVING OUTLIERS: Average Glucose Level**\

Here, when we tried to remove outliers and upsample our data, because of only 400 values for stroke = 1 and less variation the relationship which was present before upsampling the data was lost due to outlier removal.\

**Important Observation while Sampling**\
Hence removing outliers without checking the max values and there meaning is not always a good idea. We should make sure that the
meaning of distribution is not lost.\
We made sure that the relationships before and after Sampling the data are intact.\

Secondly, since glucoseGroup was formed based on avg_glucose_level, SMOTE being unaware of the cutoffs for Normal, Prediabetes and Diabetes didn't provide the expected results. So, we will divide the data again into 3 categories for our analysis.\

Since Upsampling is done, we can now remove the outliers
```{r results='markup'}

#dim(cleanData)
quartiles_glucose <- quantile(cleanData_outliers$avg_glucose_level, probs=c(.25, .75), na.rm = FALSE)
IQR_glucose <- IQR(cleanData$avg_glucose_level)

 
Lower_glucose <- quartiles_glucose[1] - 1.5*IQR_glucose
Upper_glucose <- quartiles_glucose[2] + 1.5*IQR_glucose

#since all the missing values are for stroke =0 entries, we will directly drop it

cleanData_outliers <- subset(cleanData_outliers, cleanData_outliers$avg_glucose_level > Lower_glucose & cleanData_outliers$avg_glucose_level < Upper_glucose)

#dim(cleanData)
```


**Plots before removing outliers**\

```{r fig.show="hold", out.width="50%"}
#plot_boxplot(cleanData, by = "stroke")


ggplot(data = cleanData, mapping = aes(y = bmi)) +
  geom_boxplot() + geom_boxplot( colour="black", fill="red", outlier.colour="red", outlier.shape=8, outlier.size=2)+
labs(title = "Boxplot of BMI before removing Outliers ",
       y = "BMI")#plotting the boxplot for bmi values.

ggplot(data = cleanData_outliers, mapping = aes(y = bmi)) +
  geom_boxplot() + geom_boxplot( colour="black", fill="red", outlier.colour="red", outlier.shape=8, outlier.size=2)+
labs(title = "Boxplot of BMI after removing Outliers ",
       y = "BMI")#plotting the boxplot for bmi values.



#ggplot(data = cleanData, mapping = aes(y = age)) +
#  geom_boxplot() + geom_boxplot( colour="black", fill="green", outlier.colour="red", outlier.shape=8, outlier.size=2)  #plotting the boxplot for bmi values.

#plot_qq(cleanData, by = "stroke")
```

**Plots after Removing outliers**\

```{r fig.show="hold", out.width="50%"}
#plot_boxplot(cleanData, by = "stroke")



ggplot(data = cleanData, mapping = aes(y = avg_glucose_level)) +
  geom_boxplot() + geom_boxplot( colour="black", fill="yellow", outlier.colour="red", outlier.shape=8, outlier.size=2) +
labs(title = "Boxplot of BMI before removing Outliers ",
       y = "Avg Glucose Level")#plotting the boxplot for avg_glucose level values.



ggplot(data = cleanData_outliers, mapping = aes(y = avg_glucose_level)) +
  geom_boxplot() + geom_boxplot( colour="black", fill="yellow", outlier.colour="red", outlier.shape=8, outlier.size=2)+
labs(title = "Boxplot of Average Glucose Level before removing Outliers ",
       y = "Average Glucose Level")#plotting the boxplot for Avg Glucose Level values.
#ggplot(data = cleanData_outliers, mapping = aes(y = age)) +
#  geom_boxplot() + geom_boxplot( colour="black", fill="green", outlier.colour="red", outlier.shape=8, outlier.size=2)  #plotting the boxplot for bmi values.

#plot_qq(cleanData, by = "stroke")

cleanData = cleanData_outliers
```


**Since our data is clean now, let' look at the QQ-plots for age, bmi, averge glucose level.**\ 

### **CHECKING NORMALITY AFTER CLEANING**\ 
As seen from below graph, average glucose level and bmi are close to Normal Distribution now.\

```{r fig.show="hold", out.width="33%"}
## Q-Q Plot to check normality of Numeric Variables 

qqnorm(cleanData$age, main="Q-Q plot of age", col="blue", ylab="age quantiles")
qqline(cleanData$age)

qqnorm(cleanData$bmi, main="Q-Q plot of bmi", col="green", ylab="bmi quantiles")
qqline(cleanData$bmi)

qqnorm(cleanData$avg_glucose_level, main="Q-Q plot of avg_glucose_level", col="red", ylab="avg_glucose_level quantiles")
qqline(cleanData$avg_glucose_level)

```

### **CONVERTING AVG GLUCOSE LEVELS INTO GROUPS**\

To get a clear understanding, we converted avg_glucose_levels into 3 categories as per medical research:\
* 0-114 : Normal glucose level\
* 114-140 : Prediabetes\
* 140- infinity : Diabetes\

Along with numeric values we want to get insights on the different groups as well. Because according to research people with diabetes are more likely to get stroke which is what we can see from our plots as well
Here, as we can see, **people who have diabetes are more likely to get stroke.**\

```{r results='asis'}
cleanData$glucoseGroup=cut(cleanData$avg_glucose_level, c(0, 114, 140, Inf), c("Normal", "Prediabetes", "Diabetes"), include.lowest=TRUE)
#0-114 : Normal glucose level
#114-140 : Prediabetes
#140- infinity : Diabetes 
```

```{r results='asis'}
#glucoseGroup to stroke relations
#ggbarstats(data=cleanData,y=glucoseGroup,x=stroke,label="both")
#people with diabetes have a high chance of getting stroke 
df_glucose <- cleanData %>%
  group_by(glucoseGroup, stroke) %>%
  count(stroke)
#grouping data into three glucose level

df_glucose %>%
ggplot(mapping = aes(x = glucoseGroup, y = n, fill = factor(stroke))) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "fill") +
  labs(title = "Percentage of subjects with Different Glucose Level", 
       x = "glucoseGroup", 
       y = "Percentage") +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Paired")

```


**Cleaning of the dataset is done. Now we will start analyzing each factor individually with stroke.**\

## **BMI**\

```{r}
ggplot(data = cleanData, mapping = aes(x = stroke, y = bmi, fill=stroke)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

The above box plot is not giving us anything concrete about stroke prediction. Since for both distributions with and without stroke, the average BMI is almost similar.\
The 3rd Quartile value for stroke = $1$ is slightly less than the value for stroke = $0$ which implies that there is no effect of BMI on brain stroke.\
**BMI VS Stroke w.r.t. Gender**\

```{r}
ggplot(data = cleanData, mapping = aes(x = stroke, y = bmi, fill = stroke, color = gender)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = "Boxplot of BMI", 
       x = "Stroke", 
       y = "BMI") +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Paired")
```

From the plot, there is no strong evidence of subjects having stroke with respect to BMI and gender.\    

which contradicts the medical results that high BMI people are more prone to getting Stroke.\

From the plot above, we can conclude that BMI is not affecting brain stroke in anyway which contradicts the medical results that high BMI people are more prone to getting Stroke.\

## **GLUCOSE LEVEL**\

```{r}
get_box_stats <- function(y, upper_limit = max(brainData$avg_glucose_level) * 1.15) {
  return(data.frame(
    y = 0.95 * upper_limit,
    label = paste(
      "Count =", length(y), "\n",
      "Mean =", round(mean(y), 2), "\n",
      "Median =", round(median(y), 2), "\n"
    )
  ))
}

ggplot(cleanData, aes(x = stroke, y = avg_glucose_level, fill = stroke)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = "Average Glucose Level versus Stroke")+
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("#0099f8", "#e74c3c", "#2ecc71")) +
  stat_summary(fun.data = get_box_stats, geom = "text", hjust = 0.5, vjust = 0.9) +
  theme_classic()
```


From the plot above, we can say that the people having higher average glucose level are more prone to brain stroke as compared to the people lower glucose levels.\

```{r}
ExpCatViz(
  cleanData %>% 
    select(stroke, glucoseGroup), 
  target="stroke",col=c("Blue", "red"))
```

From this graph we can see that when we divide glucose level into three categories namely: diabetes, normal and prediabetic, people in the prediabetic and diabetic range tend to have more strokes as compared to people in people in normal glucose level range.\

So, we can conclude that glucose level is having direct impact on stroke.\

### **SMART QUESTION 3**\
To answer SMART question 3, we tried to check the correlation between them by building a correlation matrix of numerical variables.\

**CORRELATION MATRIX OF NUMERIC VARIABLES**

```{r}
corr_data <- select_if(cleanData, is.numeric)
cor_mat <- cor(corr_data)
corrplot(cor_mat,method="number")
```

From the matrix above,\ 
>There is a correlation between avg_glucose_level and age.\
>There is a very small correlation between avg_glucose_level and bmi.\
>There is a negligible correlation between age and bmi.\


```{r}
get_box_stats1 <- function(y, upper_limit = max(bmi) * 1.15) {
  return(data.frame(
    y = 0.95 * upper_limit,
    label = paste(
      "Count =", length(y), "\n",
      "Mean =", round(mean(y), 2), "\n",
      "Median =", round(median(y), 2), "\n"
    )
  ))
}

ggplot(cleanData, aes(x = glucoseGroup, y = bmi)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = "avg glucose level distribution before sampling")+
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("#0099f8", "#e74c3c", "#2ecc71")) +
  stat_summary(fun.data = get_box_stats1, geom = "text", hjust = 0.5, vjust = 0.9) +
  theme_classic()
```


The box plot is similar for the three glucose groups.\
From the correlation matrix and the boxplot, not much correlation is observed.\

## **RESIDENCE TYPE**\

```{r}
select_res <- select(cleanData, c('Residence_type','stroke'))

res_effect <- select_res %>% 
  group_by(Residence_type, stroke) %>% 
  count(stroke)

ggplot(res_effect, aes(Residence_type, n, fill = stroke)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = 'identity', position='fill') + 
  ggtitle("Distribution for residence areas on stroke")

recycleData <- select(cleanData, -c('Residence_type'))
```

From the plot above for residence types, we notice that residence type has no effect at all on strokes. Thsi is why we are dropping the residence column, there is no use for it in our data analysis.\

## **HEART DISEASE**\
As per our prior research, history of heart disease has a huge impact on brain stroke.\
To check the same for our dataset, we will plot various graphs.\

```{r}
select_heart_disease <- select(recycleData, c('heart_disease','stroke'))

heart_effect <- select_heart_disease %>%
  group_by(heart_disease, stroke) %>% 
  count(stroke)

ggplot(heart_effect, aes(heart_disease, n, fill = stroke)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = 'identity', position='fill') + 
  ggtitle("Distribution for heart disease on stroke")
```

From the above plot, percentage of people having stroke with heart disease is significantly higher than the people having stroke with no heart disease.\


```{r}
ggplot(recycleData, aes(heart_disease, age, color = stroke)) + 
  geom_boxplot() + 
  ggtitle("Distribution for age vs heart_disease on stroke")
```

The plots above predicts that heart disease might actually have an impact on stroke but age has a bigger factor on stroke. We see that an increase in age comes with an increase in heart disease. This means that people in the higher age bracket are prone to heart diseases than people in the lower age bracket, this is the relation between heart disease and age.\

## **EVER MARRIED**\

```{r}
select_married <- select(recycleData, c('ever_married','stroke'))

married_effect <- 
  select_married %>% 
  group_by(ever_married, stroke) %>% 
  count(stroke)

ggplot(married_effect, aes(ever_married, n, fill = stroke)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = 'identity', position='fill') + 
  ggtitle("Distribution for Marriage Status on stroke")
```

```{r}
ggplot(recycleData, aes(ever_married, age, color = stroke)) + 
  geom_boxplot() + 
  ggtitle("Distribution for age vs ever_married on stroke")
```

From the plot above, we see that people who are married are more likely to get stroke but we then notice that age is a contributing factor to this hypothesis. The married people that get stroke are noticed in the older age bracket, which is why we say age is a major contributing factor to stroke.\

### **SMART QUESTION 4**\

From the above analysis, we can conclude that marital status alone cannot contribute to the stroke at all.

## **SMOKING STATUS**\

```{r}
no_na_for_smoking_status <- subset(recycleData, !is.na(smoking_status))
select_smoke <- select(no_na_for_smoking_status, c('smoking_status','stroke'))

smoke_effect <- select_smoke %>% 
  group_by(smoking_status, stroke) %>% 
  count(stroke)

ggplot(smoke_effect, aes(smoking_status, n, fill = stroke)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = 'identity', position='fill') + 
  ggtitle("Distribution for smoking_status on stroke")
```


After the analysis of smoking status against stroke where 0 is No and 1 is Yes, we notice that smoking status does not really have an effect on stroke. According to the graph, we see that people who formerly smoked have more tendency to get strokes than people who never smoked and are still smoking. This is in contradiction to medical studies which say that smoking cigarette can have a huge impact on brain stroke.\


## **GENDER**\

```{r}
ggplot(data = recycleData, mapping = aes(x = gender, y = age)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

```{r}
select_gender <- select(recycleData, c('gender','stroke'))
gender_effect <- select_gender %>% 
  group_by(gender, stroke) %>% 
  count(stroke)

ggplot(gender_effect, aes(gender, n, fill = stroke)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = 'identity', position='fill') + 
  ggtitle("Distribution for Gender on stroke")
```

```{r}
ggplot(recycleData, aes(gender, age, color = stroke)) + 
  geom_boxplot() + 
  ggtitle("Distribution for age vs gender on stroke")
```


The plots we see above indicates that if we are looking at gender alone as a factor for strokes, males are more likely to get strokes that females but this does not really prove to be a strong effect on stroke. We then plot gender with age against strokes and notice the same result we have been getting, all evidence point to age i.e Age is a huge factor to determining if an individual is prone to stroke.

## **WORKTYPE**\

```{r}
select_work <- select(recycleData, c('work_type','stroke'))
workType_effect <- select_work %>% 
  group_by(work_type, stroke) %>% 
  count(stroke)

ggplot(workType_effect, aes(work_type, n, fill = stroke)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = 'identity', position='fill') + 
  ggtitle("Distribution for Work Type on stroke")
```

```{r}
ggplot(recycleData, aes(work_type, age, color = stroke)) + 
  geom_boxplot() + 
  ggtitle("Distribution for age vs work_type on stroke")
```

From the box plot people with govt_job, private and self-employed are more likely to get heart stroke.  But when comparing with age, this might be because people who have stroke in these 3 categories are older.\
So age might be contributing to this dependence too.\


## **HYPOTHESIS TESTING**\
To support our analysis we performed **TTEST** and **CHI SQUARE TEST** on the sample variables\

### **CHI SQUARE TEST**\
**To check independence of variables.**\

```{r}
chisquare_for_dataset <- function(df) {     # defined a function to call chisquare test on different datasets. Created this function as it is getting called twice
contable_gender = table(df$gender, df$stroke)
contable_age = table(df$age, df$stroke)
contable_hypertension = table(df$hypertension, df$stroke)
contable_heart_disease = table(df$heart_disease, df$stroke)
contable_ever_married = table(df$ever_married, df$stroke)
contable_work_type = table(df$work_type, df$stroke)
contable_Residence_type = table(df$Residence_type, df$stroke)
contable_avg_glucose_level = table(df$avg_glucose_level, df$stroke)
contable_bmi = table(df$bmi, df$stroke)
contable_smoking_status = table(df$smoking_status, df$stroke)
contable_glucose_group = table(df$glucoseGroup)

chitest_gender = chisq.test(contable_gender)
chitest_age = chisq.test(contable_age)
chitest_hypertension = chisq.test(contable_hypertension)
chitest_heart_disease = chisq.test(contable_heart_disease)
chitest_ever_married = chisq.test(contable_ever_married)
chitest_work_type = chisq.test(contable_work_type)
chitest_Residence_type = chisq.test(contable_Residence_type)
chitest_avg_glucose_level = chisq.test(contable_avg_glucose_level)
chitest_bmi = chisq.test(contable_bmi)
chitest_smoking_status = chisq.test(contable_smoking_status)
chitest_glucose_group = chisq.test(contable_glucose_group)


print(chitest_gender)
print(chitest_age)
print(chitest_hypertension)
print(chitest_heart_disease)
print(chitest_ever_married)
print(chitest_work_type)
print(chitest_Residence_type)
print(chitest_avg_glucose_level)
print(chitest_bmi)
print(chitest_smoking_status)
print(chitest_glucose_group)

}
```



NULL HYPOTHESIS,$H_0$ : The store value is independent  of the variable.
ALTERNATE HYPOTHESIS, $H_1$ :  The stroke value is dependent on the variable. 

From the CHI SQUARE TEST, we can see that the p-value of stroke with ever_married and stroke with residence_type are relatively bigger than all other p-values.\
Which means that we cannot reject the NULL hypothesis.\

This implies that stroke is not dependent on marital status and residence type of the person.\

### **TTEST**\
**To check similarity of distributions.**\

```{r}
subset_stroke_1 = subset(cleanData, cleanData$stroke == 1)
subset_stroke_0 = subset(cleanData, cleanData$stroke == 0)


ttest2sample_age = t.test(subset_stroke_1$age, subset_stroke_0$age)
ttest2sample_bmi = t.test(subset_stroke_1$bmi, subset_stroke_0$bmi)
ttest2sample_glucose = t.test(subset_stroke_1$avg_glucose_level, subset_stroke_0$avg_glucose_level)

print(ttest2sample_age)
```

**Age TTEST**\
*NULL hypothesis*: Means of age with subjects having stroke and not having stroke are same i.e. same distributions.\
*Alternate Hypothesis*: Means of age with subjects having stroke and not having stroke are different i.e. different distributions.\
Pvalue is very small so we can reject the NULL hypothesis. So age with stroke and age without stroke have different distributions.\

**BMI TTEST**\
*NULL hypothesis*: Means of BMI values with subjects having stroke and not having stroke are same i.e. same distributions.\
*Alternate Hypothesis*: Means of BMI values with subjects having stroke and not having stroke are different i.e. different distributions.\
Pvalue is not small so we cannot reject the NULL hypothesis. So BMI with stroke and BMI without stroke have same distributions.\

**Glucose level TTEST**\
*NULL hypothesis*: Means of glucose levels with subjects having stroke and not having stroke are same i.e. same distributions.\
*Alternate Hypothesis*: Means of glucose levels with subjects having stroke and not having stroke are different i.e. different distributions.\
Pvalue is very small so we can reject the NULL hypothesis. So glucose levels with stroke and glucose levels without stroke have different distributions.\

## **CONCLUSION**\

$1.$ The risk of stroke increases with age.\
$2.$ People with hypertension have higher risk of getting a stroke.\
$3.$ People with higher average glucose levels are more prone to brain stroke.\
$4.$ People with heart disease have higher chance of getting a brain stroke.\
$5.$ Gender, marital status, worktype, residence type and BMI levels do not contribute to the brain stroke as per our dataset.\
$6.$ Smoking status does not have a major impact on stroke as per our dataset but there is some impact which is partly due to age.\

### **SMART QUESTION 2**\
From the above analysis and conclusion, we can say that stroke is dependent on hypertension and heart disease.\
But as per our dataset, smoking status does not contribute to the stroke significantly.\
